# Data-Analyst-Task-1
I removed dollar signs ($) and commas (,) from the Amount column, and then converted it into float for numerical analysis,Converted the Date column to proper datetime format so I can use it for time-based analysis later.

Checked for missing values and handled them accordingly – either filled with defaults or dropped if unnecessary also Removed any duplicate records to ensure accuracy in the dataset.

Renamed the column headers to snake_case (like sales_person, boxes_shipped, etc.) to follow a cleaner and more readable format and Finally, saved the cleaned data into a new file as✅ cleaned_chocolate_sales.csv
